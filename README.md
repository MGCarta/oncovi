# Oncogenicity Variant Interpreter (OncoVI)
OncoVI is a fully-automated Python implementation of the [oncogenicity guidelines](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35101336/) published in 2022 by Horak et al. 
Starting from the genomic location of the variants OncoVI:
1. Performs functional annotation based on the [Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)](https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html) from Ensembl 
2. Collects biological evidences from the implemented publicly available resources
3. Provides a classification of oncogenicity based on the oncogenicity guidelines.

###### The figure shows the implemented criteria in OncoVI (11 and five criteria for evidence of oncogenic and benign effect respectively), the public resources utilised to assess each criterion, the points associated with each criterion and the classification of oncogenicity into one of five classes on the basis of the variant-specific score, obtained as the sum of the points associated to the criteria triggered by OncoVI for the variant: score≥10:Oncogenic (O), 6≤score≤9:Likely Oncogenic (LO), 0≤score≤5:Variant of uncertain significance (VUS), -6≤score≤-1:Likely Benign (LB), score≤-7:Benign (B). Blue: resources suggested by the Standard Operating Procedure, black: resources identified by the authors of this study.

## Software requirements
OncoVI was implemented and tested on a dedicated conda enviroment running on a remote server based on Ubuntu's 20.04.4 long-term support (LTS) operating system.



# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.
